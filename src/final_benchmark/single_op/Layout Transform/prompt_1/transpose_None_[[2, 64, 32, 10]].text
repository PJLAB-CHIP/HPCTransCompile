    Task: Translate the given CUDA code to its equivalent High performace CPU C code.  
    Context: You are provided with a CUDA code snippet that needs to be translated into CPU C code. The translation should preserve the same functionality as much as possible. Focus on translating the CUDA-specific parallel constructs into the constructs supported by CPU, such as using OpenMP for parallelism. The resulting CPU C code should be complete and ready to compile. 
    Input CUDA Code: extern "C" __global__ void __launch_bounds__(1024) default_function_kernel(float* __restrict__ A, float* __restrict__ T_transpose) {
  T_transpose[((((int)blockIdx.x) * 1024) + ((int)threadIdx.x))] = A[(((((((int)blockIdx.x) / 20) * 20480) + ((((int)threadIdx.x) & 63) * 320)) + ((((int)blockIdx.x) % 20) * 16)) + (((int)threadIdx.x) >> 6))];
}


    Ihe input tensor shape is [[2, 64, 32, 10]] respectively, Print only single C function implementation, end with comment '|End-of-Code|'.
