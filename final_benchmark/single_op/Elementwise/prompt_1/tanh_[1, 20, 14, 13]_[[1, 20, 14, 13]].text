    Task: Translate the given CUDA code to its equivalent High performace CPU C code.  
    Context: You are provided with a CUDA code snippet that needs to be translated into CPU C code. The translation should preserve the same functionality as much as possible. Focus on translating the CUDA-specific parallel constructs into the constructs supported by CPU, such as using OpenMP for parallelism. The resulting CPU C code should be complete and ready to compile. 
    Input CUDA Code: extern "C" __global__ void __launch_bounds__(28) default_function_kernel(float* __restrict__ compute, float* __restrict__ data) {
  compute[((((int)blockIdx.x) * 28) + ((int)threadIdx.x))] = tanhf(data[((((int)blockIdx.x) * 28) + ((int)threadIdx.x))]);
}


    Ihe input tensor shape is [[1, 20, 14, 13]] respectively, Print only single C function implementation, end with comment '|End-of-Code|'.
